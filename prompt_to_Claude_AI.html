I have a small website dedicated to the Yi Jing, it is www.zhouoracle.com

I would like to make a new home page for that website, on the home page would be a virtual 

version of the yarrow stalk divination method of casting hexagrams.

I have found similar web page on the internet and I would like you to use that page as a 

starting point and improve it as much as possible so that I can put something presentable and 

something that works well on my web site.

The page I would like you to modify for me is here https://github.com/exTn68i-yRg-

p/yijing/blob/main/YarrowStalks2.htm

These are the changes I would like to see in this page:

- remove all other options except the "Traditional" yarrow stalk method with probabilities 1/16 

(6), 3/16 (9), 5/16 (7), 7/16 (8) for old yin, old yang, stable yang and stable yin line respectively;

- only Traditional yarrow stalk method should be used

- Remove background, make it light pastel yellow-orange

- totally remove "one moving line" check box,

- replace "Question or circumstances (optional): " with "Briefly describe your circumsances and 

ask a question:"

- Under the question box write (in a small font): "Please note: your information is private, this 

page remains in your browser and your information is not transmitted away from your 

computer" or something similar to the same effect

- remove "Enter lines manually (optional):" and all text below

- Remove everything else below (links etc) and use Wilelm/Baynes translation only (without 

making it known on the page)

This is for the change in the appearance.

Requested changes in functionallity:

- Please optimise and improve the code as you see it fit to the purpose,

- Keep only Willhel's translation - I already removed Nigel Richmondâ€™s and Greg Richter's 

translations however I could not remove radio button for Richmond Translation

- Improve graphic represetntation of the yarrow stalks if possible,

- Position yarrow stalks in the middle of the screen, at the top

- Below that goes the box where the question will be asked along with time/date stamp,

- below that (again in the middle) will be are where one or two hexagrams will be assembled,

- Below that goes the outcome of the divination process: on or two hexagrams, side by side, 

with their names, hexagram number, judgements, and the text of the moving lines of the first 

hexagram (as it was in the original code),

- below that is a button (or simply a javascript link to produce a PDF file and store the outcome 

of the divination as a pdf file.

I have removed from the code everything that I could remove, the rest cannot be removed (by 

me) without breaking the code and adversly affecting the functionality of the page.

IMPORTANT - Please tell me if you can produce a working version of this web page or not - I 

made similar request recently and what I was getting back was just a layout for the page 

without any functionality as far as yarrow stalks method is concerned.

Thank you!
